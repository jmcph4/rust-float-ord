A wrapper for floats that uses this ordering:

    NaN | -Infinity | x < 0 | -0 | +0 | x > 0 | +Infinity | NaN

## How does it work?

There is an [old family magic spell](http://stereopsis.com/radix.html) that
allows one to compare floating-point values without any floating-point work.
Simply interpret the fp value as an unsigned integer, flip its sign bit (if
positive) or all bits (if negative), and do the comparison normally.

The trick was developed on `f32` and `f64`, but it should work on anything
structured like the IEEE floats. Even the IEEE decimal formats.

This comparison matches the definition of an [IEEE 754 total order][754-ord]
if and only if your platform's `NAN` encoding puts the `is_quiet` bit in the
most significant position of the mantissa per recommended by IEEE 754-2008.
